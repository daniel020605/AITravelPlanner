# Supabase Connection Test Feature

This document describes the new Supabase connection test feature added to the settings page.

## Feature Overview

A new "测试连接" (Test Connection) button has been added to the Supabase configuration section in the settings page. This allows users to verify their Supabase configuration without having to perform actual data operations.

## Implementation Details

### State Management

New state variables were added to track the testing status and results:
- `supabaseTesting`: Boolean flag to indicate when a connection test is in progress
- `supabaseTestResult`: Object containing the test result with `ok` status and `message`

### Test Function

The `testSupabaseConnection` function performs the following steps:
1. Sets the testing state to true
2. Gets the Supabase client using the configured URL and Anon Key
3. Validates that both configuration values are present
4. Attempts to test the connection using multiple approaches:
   - First tries to call a simple RPC function
   - If that fails, tries to query a sample from the travel_plans table
   - Interprets different types of errors appropriately
5. Sets the test result based on the outcome
6. Resets the testing state

### User Interface

The connection test button and result display were added to the Supabase configuration section:
- A button labeled "测试连接" that triggers the test function
- Visual feedback during testing with "测试中…" text
- Result display showing success or error messages with appropriate coloring

## Error Handling

The implementation handles various error scenarios:
- Missing configuration values (URL or Anon Key)
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Database access issues
- Table existence checks

## User Experience

The feature provides immediate feedback to users about their Supabase configuration:
- Clear visual indication when a test is in progress
- Success messages when the connection is working
- Descriptive error messages when issues are detected
- Guidance on next steps (e.g., creating database tables)

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Navigate to the Settings page
2. Locate the Supabase configuration section
3. Enter valid Supabase URL and Anon Key values
4. Click the "测试连接" button
5. Observe the result message
6. Test with invalid credentials to verify error handling
