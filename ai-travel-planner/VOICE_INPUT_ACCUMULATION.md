# Voice Input Accumulation Feature

This document describes the changes made to implement voice input accumulation in the travel planner.

## Overview

The voice input functionality has been enhanced to accumulate results from multiple voice recognition sessions instead of replacing them. This allows users to provide travel planning information in multiple voice inputs, which are then combined for processing.

## Changes Made

### 1. VoiceInput Component (src/components/features/VoiceInput.tsx)

The VoiceInput component was restored to its original state with fixes for TypeScript errors:
- Fixed the undefined SpeechRecognition error
- Fixed the style jsx error by changing to regular style tags

### 2. TravelPlanner Component (src/pages/travel/TravelPlanner.tsx)

Modified the voice input handling to accumulate results:

#### For XFYun IAT (科大讯飞):
- Updated `onInterim` to accumulate interim results: `setVoiceInput(prev => prev ? prev + ' ' + t : t)`
- Updated `onFinal` to accumulate final results: `setVoiceInput(prev => prev ? prev + ' ' + t : t)`

#### For Web Speech API:
- Changed `continuous` to `true` for continuous recognition
- Changed `interimResults` to `true` to get interim results
- Modified the result handling to accumulate final text instead of replacing it
- Added proper spacing between accumulated results

#### UI Enhancements:
- Added a "清除" (Clear) button to reset accumulated voice input
- Improved button layout with separate clear and record buttons

## How It Works

1. When users click "开始录音" (Start Recording), the voice recognition begins
2. As users speak, interim results are displayed but not yet accumulated
3. When users finish speaking and the recognition finalizes a segment, it's added to the accumulated text
4. Users can continue recording multiple times, and each finalized segment is added to the accumulation
5. Users can click "清除" (Clear) to reset the accumulated text
6. The "根据识别内容填充" (Fill based on recognition) button processes all accumulated text

## Benefits

- Users can provide travel information in multiple voice inputs
- More natural conversation flow for complex travel planning
- Users don't need to remember everything in one go
- Better user experience for longer travel planning sessions

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Navigate to the travel planner page
2. Click "开始录音" and speak some travel planning information
3. Click "停止录音" to finalize the input
4. Click "开始录音" again and speak additional information
5. Observe that the new information is appended to the previous text
6. Click "清除" to reset the accumulated text
